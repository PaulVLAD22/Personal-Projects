You choose the earlier invented object and your score is stored , when you choose wrong, after you type a name, in a json file from which the leaderboard html file gets its list of scores.(I have an array of objects with the attributes name, year, time(BC/AD). I get that info from a txt file.)


Image 1 - choose what was invented earlier<br>
Image 2 - enter your name to save your score in the leaderboard (you just saw image 4)<br>
Image 3 - correct answer<br>
Image 4 - wrong answer<br>
