<h3>The better Projects : </h3>



<h3>The others : </h3>
<h4>Invention Site</h4>(HTML/CSS/JS/NODE.JS) - You choose the earlier invented object (info obtained from a txt file) and your score is stored, after you type a name, in a json file from which the leaderboard html file gets its list of scores.<strong>This one lacks in design because i m not a huge fan of web design but i like web development.</strong><br><br>
<h4>Resume Site</h4> : <a href="https://github.com/PaulVLAD22/PaulVLAD22.github.io">Github Repository</a>
