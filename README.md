<h1>Personal Projects</h1>
(To see images of the projects I'm describing here acces them in their specific folder)
<h3>The better Projects : </h3>
<h4><li>Weather App<i>(Python-Requests,Tkinter,JSON,Sqlite3)</i></h4> - Weather app that displays, using openweathermap.org's current weather data api, live statistics about the weather in different cities.<strong>Even though it lacks content, I think it's better than my other projects because I use more interesting technologies and I look forward to making other more original api-using apps.</strong>



<h3>The others : </h3>
<h4><li>Coronavirus Mobile Tracker<i>(Android Studio - Java squareup, json)</i></h4> - Very simple app , enter the name of a country and it will tell you , using an api (found on rapidapi.com,which doesn't have information about certain countries) how many cases have there been in the last 24h ,and other info. 
<h4><li>Spaceships style game <i>(Python Pygame)</i></h4> - A simple game very similar to "Space Invaders" in which the player is a rocket that shoots aliens that destroy on touch(it also has Score and Percentage of hit shots).<br>
<h4><li>Invention Site <i>(HTML/CSS/JS/NODE.JS)</i></h4> - You choose the earlier invented object (info obtained from a txt file) and your score is stored, after you type a name, in a json file from which the leaderboard html file gets its list of scores.<br><p>-After I will take an android course (in the near future) I think i will try to turn this game ideea into a mobile app and take it more seriously and combine the game logic with some real design.</p>
<h4><li>Resume Site <i>(HTML/CSS/JS)</i></h4> - Web design isn't my strongest asset but i thought it would be fun for me to try to make an online CV. I spent very little time with this one(a few days) and now i want to learn more in order to work on other projects that would be more fun to make for me.
