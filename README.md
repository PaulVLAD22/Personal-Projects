<h3>The better Projects : </h3>



<h3>The others : </h3>
<h4><li>Invention Site</h4>(HTML/CSS/JS/NODE.JS) - You choose the earlier invented object (info obtained from a txt file) and your score is stored, after you type a name, in a json file from which the leaderboard html file gets its list of scores.<strong>This one lacks in design because I'm not a huge fan of web design but i like web development and working with javascript.</strong><br><br><h4>After I will take an android course (in the near future) I think i will try to turn this game ideea into a mobile app and take it more seriously.</h4>
<h4><li>Spaceships style game(Python Pygame) - A simple game very similar to "Space Invaders" in which the player is a rocket that shoots aliens that destroy on touch(it also has Score and Percentage of hit shots).
<h4><li>Resume Site</h4>(HTML/CSS/JS) - Web design isn't my strongest asset but i thought it would be fun for me to try to make an online CV. I spent very little time with this one(a few days) and now i want to learn more in order to work on other projects that would be more fun to make for me.
